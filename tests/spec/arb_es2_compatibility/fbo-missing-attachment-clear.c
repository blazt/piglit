/**
 * \file fbo-missing-attachment-clear.c
 * Verify that a color clear on a depth-only FBO doesn't crash
 *
 * From the ARB_ES2_compatibility spec:
 *
 *     (8) How should we handle draw buffer completeness?
 *
 *     RESOLVED: Remove draw/readbuffer completeness checks, and treat
 *     drawbuffers referring to missing attachments as if they were NONE.
 *
 * It is valid to have a depth-only FBO that has the draw buffer set to values
 * other than \c GL_NONE.  However, doing operations that would read from or
 * draw to these missing attachments should treat them as though they were
 * \c GL_NONE (i.e., don't crash).
 *
 * See also https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37739.
