 * Tests that starting conditional rendering on a 0 query object
 * results in INVALID_OPERATION.
 *
 * From the NV_conditional_render spec:
 *
 *     "BeginQuery sets the active query object name for the query
 *      type given by <target> to <id>.  If BeginQuery is called with
 *      an <id> of zero, if the active query object name for <target>
 *      is non-zero, if <id> is the active query object name for any
 *      query type, or if <id> is the active query object for
 *      condtional rendering (Section 2.X), the error INVALID
 *      OPERATION is generated."
